In my line of work, you learn to look for the things that don't belong.
 A man walking in the rain without an umbrella isn't weird.
  A man walking in the rain, completely dry, with a small,

   hat's a Tuesday in this neighborhood. I
    followed him, 

trying to keep my shadow hidden in the alley’s deep grime.
